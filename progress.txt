2026-02-19 - UI/UX redesign progress

Phase 1 - Critical (implemented)
- Unified core public-page shell layout with section-shell/content-container hierarchy.
- Reworked Workshop, Projects, Team, Contact pages to use shared visual primitives.
- Improved legal-page container sizing and removed undefined motion classes on Home.
- Added responsive mobile-card views for admin lists (Projects, Team, Products).

Phase 2 - Refinement (implemented)
- Legal pages (Impressum, Datenschutz): aligned typography, panel treatment, and link styles to system classes.
- Admin Projects/Team/Products: standardized action buttons, form controls, and panel surfaces using:
  - btn-primary / btn-secondary
  - field-control + focus-ring
  - glass-panel / glass-panel--soft
- Preserved existing behavior and data flow; no feature or logic changes.

Validation
- Typecheck passed: npm run -s typecheck
- Dev server available at http://localhost:5173

2026-02-19 - Hotfix Mietshop Produktdetailseiten
- Fixed slug handling for `/mietshop/:slug` routes:
  - URL-decoding applied for route segment parsing.
  - Empty trailing-slash slug now falls back to `/mietshop` list rendering.
  - Product lookup accepts both raw and URL-decoded slug candidates.
- Added resilient product-detail empty-content fallbacks for:
  - short description
  - full description
  - suitable-for text
  - scope-of-delivery text
  - technical specs (informative placeholder when none exist)
- Validation:
  - Typecheck passed: npm run -s typecheck
  - Verified encoded slug candidate resolves to active product row.

2026-02-19 - Encoding cleanup (visible mojibake)
- Repaired malformed UTF-8 text fragments in public pages:
  - `src/pages/ContactPage.tsx`
  - `src/pages/ProjectsPage.tsx`
  - `src/pages/TeamPage.tsx`
  - `src/pages/WorkshopPage.tsx`
- Repaired malformed UTF-8 text fragments in admin pages/components:
  - `src/components/AdminGuard.tsx`
  - `src/pages/admin/LoginPage.tsx`
  - `src/pages/admin/AdminProjectsPage.tsx`
  - `src/pages/admin/AdminTeamPage.tsx`
  - `src/pages/admin/ProductsPage.tsx`
- Fixed remaining replacement characters (`�`) in affected copy and confirm dialogs.
- Validation:
  - No remaining mojibake markers (`Ã`, `Â`, `â`, `�`) found in `src/`.
  - Typecheck passed: npm run -s typecheck
